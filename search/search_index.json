But how exactly do we update these parameters efficiently?</p> <p>This is where optimizers come in. Their role is pivotal. Optimizers are algorithms or methods used to minimize (or maximize) a loss function by updating the model\u2019s parameters during training. In essence, they guide the model toward better performance, one step at a time, using feedback from the loss function.</p> <p>As deep learning models grow in complexity and size, training them becomes not just a matter of mathematical correctness but also computational efficiency. Optimizers, alongside techniques like weight initialization and batch normalization, have become central to speeding up the training process, reducing the number of epochs required to converge, and stabilizing learning behavior.</p> <p>To understand the value of an optimizer, consider this: no matter how elegant your neural network architecture is, poor optimization can trap it in suboptimal local minima or slow down learning to a crawl. Conversely, a well-chosen optimizer can unlock the full potential of your model by navigating the loss landscape intelligently.</p> <p>In this chapter, we\u2019ll walk through the conceptual underpinnings of optimizers, examine why they matter, and progressively build an understanding of different optimization techniques\u2014from the classical ones to those designed for modern deep learning systems.

At its core, a neural network is a parameterized function\u2014its parameters being the weights and biases spread across its layers. These parameters define how input data flows through the network and ultimately determines the predictions the model makes.</p> <p>However, a freshly initialized neural network knows nothing about the task at hand. Its initial predictions are random, stemming from weights and biases that were, by design, randomly assigned. This brings us to the essential problem: how do we tune these parameters so that the model's predictions become meaningful?</p> <p>The answer lies in optimization. The goal of training a neural network is to find the optimal values for its parameters so that its predictions closely match the actual target values. This notion of \"closeness\" is mathematically captured by a loss function\u2014a measure of how far the model\u2019s predictions are from the ground truth. The lower the loss, the better the model is performing.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the catch: the loss function is itself a function of the model parameters. That is, the value of the loss depends on the current weights and biases. To minimize the loss, we need to find the right combination of parameter values that lead to the smallest possible loss.</p> <p>This gives rise to a compelling visualization\u2014imagine the loss function as a landscape, where each point on the surface represents a particular configuration of model parameters and the height at that point indicates the corresponding loss. In a simple case with only two parameters, we could plot this as a 3D surface with valleys (low loss) and peaks (high loss). In reality, neural networks involve millions of parameters, so this landscape exists in a very high-dimensional space. Nevertheless, the intuition remains: our job is to descend this landscape to reach the bottom\u2014a point of minimal loss.</p> <p>However, we don\u2019t know this landscape ahead of time, nor do we know where the valleys are. We must navigate it blindly, starting from some random point and taking small steps based on the slope of the terrain around us.</p> <p>This is precisely the role of an optimizer. It provides the strategy for updating the parameters based on the current slope of the loss surface (i.e., gradients), helping the model gradually move toward better performance. Without an optimizer, the model has no direction, no guide\u2014just a vast parameter space and no way to improve.</p> <p>In the next section, we\u2019ll begin our exploration of optimization techniques by introducing the simplest and most foundational one\u2014Gradient Descent\u2014which serves as the building block for nearly all modern optimizers.</p>"},{"location":"deep%20learning/optimizers/#gradient-descent-the-foundational-optimizer","title":"Gradient Descent: The Foundational Optimizer","text":"<p>Now that we understand the need for an optimizer to navigate the loss landscape, let\u2019s begin with the most fundamental technique in the deep learning toolkit: Gradient Descent.
